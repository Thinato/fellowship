## Phase 0 — Branch + scaffolding

- **Started:** 2026-05-06
- **Branch:** feat/agentic-ui
- **Status:** done
- **Acceptance evidence:**
  - Branch `feat/agentic-ui` cut from master @ `c5434cd` (`feat: prefix+o to cycle pane focus`).
  - Plan tracked on branch at `docs/plans/agentic-ui-v1.md`. Working copy retained at `.omc/plans/agentic-ui-v1.md` (gitignored).
  - `JOURNAL.md` created (this file).
  - `agents/` directory created with 5 placeholder role prompt files: `pm.md`, `orchestrator.md`, `architect.md`, `recon.md`, `engineer.md`.
  - CI gate green on the pre-commit snapshot: `cargo check`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all-targets` (68 passed, 0 failed).
- **Notes:**
  - Master had one master-quality feature uncommitted at session start (`prefix+o` pane cycle). Committed to master as `c5434cd` before branching (path A from the planning interview).
  - `docs/plans/agentic-ui-v1.md` is the source of truth. The `.omc/plans/` copy is a scratch working copy and may drift — always reconcile to `docs/plans/` before referencing.
  - Role markdown files are placeholders only. Phase 10 fleshes out the actual role content (system prompts, allowed tools, heartbeat protocol, forbidden commands).
